# ModernMnemonics
# Project Concept
Our project is a direct response to the societal trend of younger generations preferring short-form media and reflects a speculative design approach. It raises questions about how integrating education and entertainment could shape future learning habits and societal values.
Modern Mnemonics is a term we created to describe digital-media-driven content that combines entertainment and education, echoing the purpose of traditional mnemonics. This includes elements like music, memes, video games, and AI-generated content to make information more engaging and memorable. It prompts reflection on critical questions: Is pure memorization without genuine understanding beneficial? Is the overconsumption of short-form media helping or harming society? Could it shorten attention spans even further and make us "dumber" as a result?
We envision a future where even basic tasks, like taking a shower, are learned solely through entertainment, and complex subjects like quantum mechanics are studied via Instagram Reels or TikToks on a bed, rather than through traditional methods.
To explore this vision, we developed a website that generates modern mnemonics using AI to make learning engaging and memorable. By combining elements of entertainment, digital media, and interactive tools, the chatbot transforms everything from basic tasks to complex knowledge into digestible, personalized formats. Users can choose between three distinct modes—Brainrot Mode, Song Mode, and Chatbot Mode—each designed to cater to different learning styles while keeping the experience entertaining and immersive.

# Technical Implementation:
We developed the website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the ChatGPT API to ensure functionality and seamless interaction across the three modes.
Brainrot Mode:
Inspired by short-form media trends, Brainrot Mode integrates video game clips with real time AI-generated, TikTok-style captions to explain user-selected topics.
Users can choose from three popular video game clips: Minecraft, Subway Surfers, and GTA.
Captions include humorous memes, pop culture references, and short educational facts, ensuring engagement and retention.
Song Mode:
Song Mode allows users to select a genre (Pop, Rap, or Nursery Rhyme) to generate AI-generated lyrics about their chosen topic.
The system incorporates popular tracks like “APT” by Rosé and Bruno Mars, “DNA” by Kendrick Lamar, “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star”, and many more popular songs to create familiarity and enhance memorization.
Users receive playful yet educational songs matching their selected genre, making learning both entertaining and memorable.
Chatbot Mode:
Users can interact with one of three AI-generated personas: Naruto Uzumaki, LeBron James, or Batman. Each character provides unique responses tailored to their style and personality.
The chatbot interface dynamically changes to match the selected character’s theme, enhancing immersion.
Users can save mnemonic outputs for future reference, ensuring accessibility beyond the initial interaction.
Mnemonics like lyrics can be saved.
